            <h2>What is this demo about?</h2>
            <p>
This demonstration is a proof-of-concept asserting that we can have a unified,
secure identity and login solution for the Web. The technology is capable of
storing and transmitting your identity credentials (email address,
payment processor, shipping address, driver's license, passport, etc.) while
also protecting your privacy from those that would want to track and sell your
online browsing behavior. It is in the same realm of technology as
Mozilla Persona and OpenID Connect.
            </p>
            <p>
This website is based on the
<a href="http://manu.sporny.org/2014/credential-based-login/">
Identity Credentials</a> technology being developed by the
<a href="https://web-payments.org/">Web Payments Community Group</a> at the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>. It
consists of an ecosystem of four websites:
            </p>
            <dl>
            <dt>Identity Provider (identus.org)</dt>
            <dd>
The Identity Provider stores your identity document and any information about
you including any credentials that other sites may issue to you. You will
do several things on this site during the demo:
              <ul>
                <li>
Create an identity.
                </li>
                <li>
Register your identity with the Login Hub.
                </li>
                <li>
Generate a verified email credential and store it in your identity.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>Login Hub (login-hub.com)</dt>
            <dd>
This site helps other websites discover your identity provider in a way that
protects your privacy from both the website you're logging into as well as your
identity provider. Eventually the functionality of this website will be
implemented directly in browsers, but until that happens, it is used to
bootstrap the discovery of and login/credential transmission process for
the identity provider. You should use a separate passphrase for this site,
preferably generated via a password manager like LastPass, and you will use
that passphrase to log into sites other than your identityprovider site. You
will do the following things with this site during the demo:
              <ul>
                <li>
Register your identity, creating an association between your identity
provider and the email address and passphrase you use on the login hub.
                </li>
                <li>
Login to a website.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>Credential Issuer (credential.club)</dt>
            <dd>
This site is responsible for verifying information about you like your
home address, driver's license, and passport information. Once the site has
verified some information about you, it can issue a credential to you. For
the purposes of the demonstration, all verifications are simulated and you
will immediately be given a credential when you ask for one. All credentials
are digitally signed by the issuer which means their validity can be proven
without the need to contact the issuer (or be online). You will use this site
to:
              <ul>
                <li>
Login using an email credential.
                </li>
                <li>
Issue other credentials to yourself like a business address, proof of age,
driver's license, and digital passport.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>Single Sign-On Demo (NOT IMPLEMENTED)</dt>
            <dd>
The single sign-on website is be used to demonstrate the simplicity
of credential-based login. The sign-on process requires you to click a login
button, enter your email and passphrase on the Login Hub, and then verify
that you would like to transmit the requested credential to the single
sign-on website. You will use this site to:
              <ul>
                <li>
Present various credentials to log in.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </dd>
            </dl>

            </p>
            <h2>What is this site?</h2>
            <p>
This site is a technology demonstration of an Identity Credentials login
masking service. It provides two important services for a decentralized,
privacy-aware login solution. The first service is to use your email address
and passphrase to discover your identity provider. The second service is to
protect your privacy by not allowing your identity provider to track which
websites you're logging in to. This website's technology is based on a set of
specifications that are being worked on as a part of the
<a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://web-payments.org/">
Web Payments Community Group</a> work at the World Wide Web Consortium.
The source code is
<a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/opencred-idp">available on Github</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>What's so special about this technology?</h2>
            <p>
The Web does not have a standards-based, privacy-aware, single sign-on solution.
It also does not have a way to prove who you are to websites in a way that's
easy and secure. The experimental technology on this website, allows you to:
<ul>
  <li>
Bypass the need to create usernames and passwords to login to websites,
replacing the login process with a far more secure mechanism based on
cryptography and digital signatures.
  </li>
  <li>
Be in control of your identities online by ensuring that you own and control
your identity data.
  </li>
  <li>
Associate digitally signed credentials such as a shipping address,
preferred payment service, driver's license, proof of age, and electronic
passports with your identity and then transmit those credentials
to websites that require the information on an as-needed basis.
  </li>
  <li>
Be in control of who can and can't track your login behavior online.
  </li>
</ul>
            <h2>Isn't this just Persona, or WebID+TLS, or OpenID Connect?</h2>
            <p>
No. Mozilla Persona has removed all paid engineers from the project,
so the chances of it becoming a Web standard at this point are quite low.
Persona also doesn't let you store and transmit arbitrary credential
information. WebID+TLS sends information across the TLS channel, which is
not accessible by many pieces of software that operate at the website
level. WebID+TLS also depends on the use of client-side certificates that are
managed by the browser, which are difficult to use for most
non-technologists. OpenID Connect is complex. It is also not privacy aware and
allows the identity providers to track which sites you're visiting.
Transmitting credential information in OpenID Connect is not clearly defined.
That said, this project applauds both the Persona and OpenID work, and does
plan to provide compatability layers for each login mechanism to ensure that
the login mechanism demonstrated on this site will be compatible with
both Persona and OpenID Connect.
